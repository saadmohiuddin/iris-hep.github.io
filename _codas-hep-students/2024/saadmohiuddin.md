## My research:
I am part of the Flavor Tagging group at ATLAS. My qualification task is calibrating light jet mistag rate for GN2 - a graph neural network based b tagger.
I am also involved with a model agnostic Anomaly Detection analysis: https://mc.hep.anl.gov/asc/adfilter/manual.php
## My expertise is:
Flavor tagging in ATLAS. I am also trying to get into Using Machine Learning to enhance physics analyses.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Using parallel computing to optimize code.

## I've got my eyes on:
TO-EDIT

## I want to know more about:
